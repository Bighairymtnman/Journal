A simple, clean, and modern desktop application for journaling and daily reflections.

## About The Project

The Journal App was created to offer a peaceful and minimal environment for capturing thoughts, prayers, reflections, or anything else on your mind.

This app shares the same foundation as the Bible App and is packaged as a cross-platform desktop application using Electron.

  - **Date Created**

* **Distraction-Free Writing:** Write whatever you want in each entry using a simple, clean text editor.
* **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally using SQLiteâ€”no internet or cloud required.
